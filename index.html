			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<article>
				<h3>General</h3>
				<p>I am currently a Senior at St. Joseph's Catholic School in South Carolina. I am currently taking a web design class and this website includes the work I have been doing as a part of the curriculum for this class. My favorite color is purple.</p>

				<h3>Family</h3>
				<p>I have two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. My older brother is in college right now, but my sister is a freshman in high school. My family spends a lot of time together; we love watching shows like Family Feud and playing games. We frequently play card games and board games, and we are extremely competitive.</p>

				<p>When I am not studying, I play the piano and also throw the discus and shotput for my school's track team. I also really enjoy waterskiing. I plan to join a waterski team in college.</p>

				<h3>Music</h3>
				<p>I like to listen to all different kinds of music. One fun thing my sister and I do on the way to school in the morning is we pick themes for each day and listen to music according to that theme. For example, we have "alphabet day" where we pick a letter of the alphabet and only listen to songs whose titles start with that letter. We also have Boyband Fridays frequently.</p>
